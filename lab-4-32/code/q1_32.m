% Bit depth (B) is the number of bits available for each sample . 
% The higher the bit depth, the higher the quality of the audio.
% Frequency √ó bit depth √ó channels = bit rate
% Number of levels = 2^B  

% Using lower sampling frequency than the true ùëìùë†:
% The sample rate is how many samples of the sound are taken each second. 
% The lesser samples that are taken, lesser is the detail about where the waves rise and fall is recorded
% lesser is the quality of the audio.
% It also changes the play time.

% Using higher sampling frequency than the true ùëìùë†:
% The higher the sample rate, the higher frequencies a system can record.
% If we increase the sampling frequency, the distance between the desired component and Fs/2 increases.
% It also changes the play time.

% The property of Fourier transform that can be used to explain the observations above is frequency scaling
