% Computed the partial Fourier sum from a given vector of Fourier series coefficients { ùëéùëò } and 
% reconstructed the square wave using the function ‚Äúpartialfouriersum‚Äù and ploted it
% Repeated this as N is increased (N = 50,100,1000). 
% As N keeps increasing the plot gradually loses it's sinc shape, as t tends to 0 the real part of x(t) keeps increasing.
