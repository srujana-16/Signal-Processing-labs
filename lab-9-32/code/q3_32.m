% In case of least-squares FIR, the magnitude of sidelobes decreases gradually and the slope of phase plot is somewhat linearly incresing. 
% In case of equiripple FIR, the magnitude of sidelobes is constant and the slope for phase graph is somewhat increasing exponentially if we draw
% a line/curve across the plot of phase.
